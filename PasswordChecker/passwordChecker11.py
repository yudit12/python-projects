Password checker
read passwords from given password file you want to check  if they  ever been hacked
return how many time  each password  was  hacked  (using API)

website to check if you ben pwened:
https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords

 the  password strength based on k-anonymity k-anonymity
 k-anonymity mean we allows somebody receive information about us with out knowing who we are
 how it's done?
when we requests  password pwend API the requests.get url includes the password, converted to hash furthermore, for more security it add only the first 5 characters of the  result hash password
the response is the all hash password that their beginning  fits to your given password hash beginning
so we get a lot of  fit hash password

*******
hash function-  function that  generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets
 hashes rules
- one way - given the hash you cant know what the input was
- for the same input the result is always the same hash
- changing one char absolutely changing  the output hash
